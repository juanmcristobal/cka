# `emptyDir` Volumes

Kubernetes `emptyDir` volumes are a temporary storage solution that is created when a Pod is assigned to a node and is destroyed when the Pod is removed from that node. This type of volume is useful for sharing files between containers running in the same Pod.

## Key Features
- **Temporary Storage**: The lifecycle of an `emptyDir` volume is tied to the Pod. If the Pod is deleted, the data stored in the `emptyDir` volume is also deleted.
- **Sharing Data**: Containers in the same Pod can use an `emptyDir` volume to share files.
- **Multiple Mediums**: By default, `emptyDir` volumes are stored on the disk of the host machine. However, you can specify `memory` as the medium to tell Kubernetes to mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you.

## Use Cases
- **Scratch Space**: For temporary storage of data that should not persist beyond the life of the Pod.
- **Checkpointing**: For saving data processed by one container before passing it to another container in the same Pod.
- **Log Aggregation**: For collecting logs from various components of an application running in separate containers of the same Pod.

## Configuration Example

Here is a basic example of how to define an `emptyDir` volume in a Pod manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      name: shared-volume
  volumes:
  - name: shared-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

## Best Practices
- **Use for Temporary Data Only**: Since data in `emptyDir` volumes is deleted when Pods are removed, only use them for data that does not need to persist.
- **Consider Memory Usage**: If using `emptyDir` with the `memory` medium, be mindful of the Pod's memory usage since this can affect the node's overall resources.
